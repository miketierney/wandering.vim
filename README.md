This is a port of Matthew Anderson's 'Wandering' TextMate theme, built up using Todd Werth's 'IR Black' VIM theme (which is in turn a port of his own TextMate theme). I'm really just standing on the shoulders of giants here, but I really like Matt's theme, and nothing in VIM comes close.

There's still a lot of work to be done (for example, it still has all of the IR Black terminal colors), but I'll update as frequently as possible. Contributions are, of course, more than welcome. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request to get your own updates included.
