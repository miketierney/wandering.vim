## About ##
This is a port of [Matthew Anderson's](https://github.com/wanderingmatt) 'Wandering' TextMate theme, built up using [Todd Werth's](https://github.com/twerth) 'IR Black' VIM theme (which is in turn a port of his own TextMate theme). I'm really just standing on the shoulders of giants here, but I really like Matt's theme, and nothing in VIM comes close.

There's still a lot of work to be done (for example, it still has all of the IR Black terminal colors), but I'll update as frequently as possible. Contributions are, of course, more than welcome. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request to get your own updates included.

My main editing experiences encompass Ruby (and Rails), HTML/ERB/HAML, SASS/CSS, and Javacsript. Those are my highest priorities. As I start using other languages (PHP, sadly, is probably next up), I'll add support for various facets that they bring to the table. This being said, I'm not against adding in support for additional languages (Python, Java, etc), but since I don't use those in any capacity day-to-day, I'm going to have to rely on the input of others.


## Still to be done ##
* Console-friendly colors
* Java syntax
* More robust Ruby support (and Rails, ERB, etc)
* Testing on HAML and SASS
* Testing on Javascript
